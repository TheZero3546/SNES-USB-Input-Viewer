# SNES-USB-Input-Viewer
Program made for streamers and such to show usb inputs SNES-style.


**The compiled program can be found on the application.windows32 and application.windows64 folders**

**It needs java to run**



This has been made with Processing and the GameControlPlus library.

If the buttons do not correspond to yours, just go to the project folder, enter data folder and edit the "SNES" archive as such:
    
    -The first column is the column the general program refers to, do not touch it.
    
    -The second column is a description, just for you to know what the variable is for.
    
    -The third column is for the button type:
        
        ·One is for Button.
        
        ·Two is for hatch (Triggers).
        
        ·Three is for Slider (Sticks).
    
    -The fourth column is the one that refers to the gamepad button numbers.
    This is what you have to change.If you do not know what your input numbers are,
    just go to "control panel, devices, right click on your device and select "configure",
    on the pup up window click properties and there you have it.
   
    -The fifth and sixth columns just refer to the sliders, so no need for touching them either.
